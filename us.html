  <h2>

    Born in private hospitals and fed with infant formula instead of breastmilk, we were the generation meant to be the flags of the Chinese dream. How were our parents to know that the formula was poisonous, laced with melamine to cut costs by the very people who became glorious with them? Our parents had failed to give us freedom, so they replaced it with all that money could buy. The older generation calls us the princess generation. They say that we are materialistic and coddled. They aren’t wrong. Growing up with only the freedom of consumption has influenced the way we think, act, and express ourselves. We do not have as many opinions, as much passion. We feel powerless to change the society we live in. We don’t care about politics because we can’t affect it. Instead, we focus on what money can buy: designer bags and luxury cars, symbols of status and imported modernity. This is China post-Mao. This is socialism with Chinese characteristics. The good life cannot last. The economic boom of our parent’s generation has ended, and youth today do not have the same opportunities that were available in a rapidly growing market.
