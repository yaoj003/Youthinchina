  <h2>
    On June first, nineteen eighty nine, thousands of university students from across China were gathered in Tianammen Square. They talked, read, gave speeches, chanted, and sang patriotic songs.
    They were not anti-Chinese. They loved their country, cared for their countrymen. They sat in the Square, trying to gain the political momentum needed to negotiate with the Beijing government for democracy, greater accountability, freedom of the press, and freedom of speech.
    They had been instructed to leave, but remained in hope that an agreement could be reached with Beijing. In the next two days, many of these students would be dead. Their names were never to be recorded in history books.
    <br>
    <br>
    <a href="parents.html"> We are the children of these students, who have grown up within these limits on political expression. </a>
