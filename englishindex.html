  Past:
  <br>
  On June first nineteen eighty nine, thousands of university students from across China were gathered in Tiananmen Square.
  They talked, read, gave speeches, chanted, and sang patriotic songs. They were not anti-Chinese. They loved their country, cared for their countrymen. They sat in the Square, trying to gain the political momentum needed to negotiate with the Beijing government for democracy, greater accountability, freedom of the press, and freedom of speech. They had been instructed to leave, but remained in hope that an agreement could be reached with Beijing. In the next two days, many of these students would be dead. Their names were never to be recorded in history books. We are the children of these students, who have grown up within these limits on political expression.
  <br>
  <br>
  Our parents gave up on resistance after nineteen eighty nine. Those who didn’t were subjected to constant surveillance and long prison sentences. Most of these youths put their heads down and went to work. China had opened up to the world only ten years prior, and there was money to be made. To be rich was glorious, and many quickly attained glory. The middle class grew exponentially, and the desire for money and face replaced the passion for change. New private housing complexes popped up in the place of demolished hutongs, symbols of China’s new great leap toward modernity. Our parents, the same kids who had sat and chanted in the Square, who pulled their injured friends to safety on vegetable rickshaws, were quick to buy in. Politics seemed distant and far away. Governmental regulations became not something to protest against, but obstacles that could be moved and manipulated to one’s advantage with the correct guanxi.
  <br>
  <br>
  June fourth had proved the people’s powerlessness against the CPC. Now, it was enough to live the good life.
    <br>
    <br>
Present:
    <br>
    For those who’s parents became glorious, we have reaped the fruits of Chinese modernity. Born in private hospitals and fed with infant formula instead of breastmilk, we were the generation meant to be the flags of the Chinese dream. How were our parents to know that the formula was poisonous, laced with melamine to cut costs by the very people who became glorious with them? Our parents had failed to give us freedom, so they replaced it with all that money could buy.
    <br>
    <br>
    The older generation calls us the princess generation. They say that we are materialistic and coddled. They aren’t wrong. Growing up with only the freedom of consumption has influenced the way we think, act, and express ourselves. We do not have as many opinions, as much passion. We feel powerless to change the society we live in. We don’t care about politics because we can’t affect it. Instead, we focus on what money can buy: designer bags and luxury cars, symbols of status and imported modernity. This is China post-Mao. This is socialism with Chinese characteristics.
    <br>
    <br>
Future:
    <br>
    The good life cannot last. The economic boom of our parent’s generation has ended, and youth today do not have the same opportunities that were available in a rapidly growing market. We will not have the same economic success as our parents. With no prospect of glory ahead, how will we adjust to a increasingly commercial China?
    <br>
    <br>
    Material goods can temporarily act as a placebo against the ills of Chinese society, but we will soon have to pay the price of succeeding in a system where exceptions to the law can be brought and traded. We have enjoyed the results of our parent’s money, but forgotten the sacrifices they made and the corruption they supported. The Chinese people are unhappy, and the CPC has brought our parents to the guillotine. Will we grow disillusioned with this new China, and chose to take a stand?
    <br>
    <br>
    To my fellow princes and princesses, get out of the LV line and into the streets. Once you get there, call your driver to take you home. There is nothing you can do without damaging the wealth your parents have accumulated.
    <br>
    <br>
    To the students in Hong Kong, politics is a game of money, where the CPC is the bank and you cannot afford to buy a property. Go to prison, do not past GO, do not collect two hundred pounds.
    <br>
    <br>
    To the Chinese diaspora, I stand with you, protected by foreign laws and freedom of speech. Say what you wish, protest until you are full. Your protest achieves nothing. It cannot enter the very place you mean to resist, reach the people it is meant to effect.
    <br>
    <br>
    A resistance that does nothing and reaches no one is no better than fictional. At least fiction can be told in China. This pseudo-resistance is all we can do.
