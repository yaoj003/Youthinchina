  <h2>
    To my fellow princes and princesses:
    <br>
    Get out of the LV line and into the streets. Once you get there, call your driver to take you home. There is nothing you can do without damaging the wealth your parents have accumulated.
<br>
<br>
  To the students in Hong Kong:
  <br>
  Politics is a game of money, where the CPC is the bank and you cannot afford to buy a property. Go to prison, do not past GO, do not collect two hundred dollars.
<br>
<br>
  To the Chinese diaspora:
  <br>
  I stand with you, protected by foreign laws and freedom of speech. Say what you wish, protest to your heartâ€™s content. Your protest achieves nothing. It cannot enter the very place you mean to resist, reach the people it is meant to effect.
<br>
  A resistance that does nothing and reaches no one is no better than fictional. At least fiction can be told in China.
<br>
<br>
  This pseudo-resistance is all we can do.

    <br>
    <br>
    <a href="manifesto.html"> Here is the manifesto of a generation of cowards, a call to action that achieves nothing.</a>
