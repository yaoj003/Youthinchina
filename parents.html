  <h2>
    Our parents gave up on resistance after 1989. Those who didn’t were subjected to constant surveillance and long prison sentences. Most of these youths put their heads down and went to work.
    China had opened up to the world only ten years prior, and there was money to be made. To be rich was glorious, and many quickly attained glory. The middle class grew exponentially, and the desire for money and face replaced the passion for change.
    New private housing complexes popped up in the place of demolished hutongs, symbols of China’s new great leap toward modernity.
    <br>
    <br>
    Our parents, the same kids who had sat and chanted in the Square, who pulled their injured friends to safety on vegetable rickshaws, were quick to buy in. Politics seemed distant and far away. Governmental regulations became not something to protest against, but obstacles that could be moved and manipulated to one’s advantage with the correct guanxi. June 4th had proved the people’s powerlessness against the CPC.
